# Distributions
 Short sweet repo to reference on how to use statrs crate to simulate distributions like one would do in R


Small note: 

I recently learned that instead of working so hard to type out the dependencies alongside their version numbers inside the Cargo.toml file, you could simply type cargo add [package-name] ...

That is what I did with installing statrs.
